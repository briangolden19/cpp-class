# cpp-class
# These files are part of a project that takes an inital savings, a monthly deposit, an interest rate, and an amount of time to monitor this. It then displays how much money will be in that account both with and without taking the monthly interest rate into account. 
# I think that I did the fomatting of the output. Finding a way to make the numbers output into columns correctly was an interesting process.
# I think I could use pointers to reduce overall memory consumption and keep the code more secure. This is not necessary in such a small project but would be a better idea. 
# The part I found hardest to write was the output formatting of this project. Having the ints display did not work with the output formatting. I found I had to change the ints to strings, preserving two decimal points in the process. It just took a bit of playing around with different methods to get this to work. 
# I think that the problem solving and class writing will be useful in other projects and course work. 
# Having this code written using a seperate class and using methods as much as possible will help this code be expandable, readable, and maintainable.
